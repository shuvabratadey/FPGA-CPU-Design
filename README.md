# FPGA-CPU-Design
# Designed A CPU using ALTERA FPGA using Verilog HDL.
# This are the Full Instruction set of my CPU.

# This CPU is based on harvard architecture, so there is two types of memory one is program memory and another one is data memory.
# This is the picture of the program and data memory.

# After converting this code to binary and put in the program memory of my cpu, It will start to execute.
# This is the Picture of the FPGA Board while it Executing this instructions.
