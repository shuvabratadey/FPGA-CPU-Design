# FPGA-CPU-Design
# Designed A CPU using ALTERA FPGA using Verilog HDL.
# This are the Full Instruction set of my CPU.
# [Full Instruction Set](https://github.com/shuvabratadey/FPGA-CPU-Design/blob/main/Program/instruction_set.txt)
# This CPU is based on harvard architecture, so there is two types of memory one is program memory and another one is data memory.
# This is the picture of the program and data memory.
